# BinarySearchTree
C# Tree where smaller nodes are assigned left and where larger nodes are assigned right. Similar nodes are prohibited.
Each node contains an array of Connections, though the Connections are not used in any tree structuring and the Connections can be changed to whatever suits one's needs.
